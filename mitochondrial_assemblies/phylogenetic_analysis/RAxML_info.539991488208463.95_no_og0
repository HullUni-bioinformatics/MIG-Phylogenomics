Alignment has 198 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 0.02%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 12 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 100 inferences on the original alignment using 100 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heteorgeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
